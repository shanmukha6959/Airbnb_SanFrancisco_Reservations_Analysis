# Airbnb_SanFrancisco_Reservations_Analysis

### Introduction
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locales. All avid travelers widely enjoy the platform for its access to holiday lets ranging from single rooms to entire properties, varying in quality and affordability, and offering a markedly different experience to that found in a hotel. In recent years the impact of Airbnbâ€™s service on local economics and rental markets has come under the spotlight. In big cosmopoliton cities with a lot of tourism, landlords move their properties out of the long-term rentals and for-sale markets, and into the short-term rental market by turning their rooms and properties into short-term lets which offers an alternative and lucrative source of revenue. But the prices of these properties should be optimally set, given the demand, and other property-specific factors.

### About the Dataset
